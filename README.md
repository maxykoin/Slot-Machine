# PYTHON SLOT MACHINE by [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th4OBktqK1I&list=WL&index=42)
- user can bet on 3 different lines
- multiply their bet by the value of the line & add it to their balance
- allow them to keep playing until desired cash out or run out of money

What I did while trying on this project was hearing what it was supposed to do, and doing it my way, only checking the tutorial for explanations and fixes. The code is not exact the same as the original, since I adapted it to my knowledge and things I personally thought worked better. It was a nice learning experience, as I was tired of doing small python projects.

# What I learned
- .isdigit()
- better understanding of constants and `for i in range()`
- pratical use of `try` and `except`
- quick problem solving
- lists & dictionaries in practice
